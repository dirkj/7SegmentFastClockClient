# 7-Segment FastClock / Counter Display

This is a controller for a LED driven 7-segment clock/counter display. An ESP8266 offers WiFi access for configuration/setting purpose and the ability to retrieve the current time through NTP.

But it might as well be used as a fast clock display for model railroads.

Prerequisites:

* WS-2812 based adressable LED chain forming the 7-segment display
* number of LEDs per segment is configurable
